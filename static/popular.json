It's open in the evening time and the best time to go there is during Fridays and other public holidays. \n\nThey have a lot of popular game activities for children of all age groups. \n\nIt's a great place to hang out and relax. \n\nThey have a prayer room at the entrance of the park.\n\nThe jawatha Masjid is also a great place to visit . The only problem is the masjid is closed to the public and the washrooms are closed as well. You can wash yourself at the park restrooms and pray outside the masjid near its entrance.  \n\nI visited it during the day on a Friday and it was a beautiful place to be.",

The house is called Al Makkiyah and was 10 years in the making.\nDr Angawi built his house according to the wind. Capturing the wind from the north to the west, the house uses natural ventilation for half  of the year, throughout  different levels, limiting the need for air conditioning \nThe house is constructed from many locally sourced materials. Dr Angawi‚Äôs wife Amira is an interior designer and whenever you see interior photographs of the house, you can see just how talented she is.\nI discovered that the house is only available for visits and viewing at particular times and for group tours.\nThere was no such opportunity when I was in Jeddah, other than admiring the exterior of the house.\nThe research I did allowed me to discover that when there are opportunities for visits to the house the tickets cost around 200 riyals, which I believe includes tea being served to you.\nIt is difficult to find information on how you obtain tickets to see the house, if indeed this is still possible.\nI would have loved to see the interior of this architectural masterpiece",

There are different rates¬† for different boats and yachts. You can choose your timings, we went from 9am to 1pm.\nWe were a group of 10 people and opted for this boat in frame and it costed us total sr1000 + sr130 (fruit basket) for 4 hours. \n\nKeep exploring for more boats as you can get cheaper ones too, we got to know about the cheaper ones after we had booked and did the advance payment. So keep contacting different boat guides. \n\nActivities-üö§\n‚Ä¢If you're lucky then you can get to see dolphins, turtles and fish. Unfortunately we couldn't see dolphins or turtles.üê¨üê¢üê†\nTip- carry khubs or roti so that seagulls can come closer to you. \n\n‚Ä¢ Our boat anchored¬† into the middle of the sea where there was shallow water and we stayed there for around 2 hours. It was definitely the best experience from the whole boat ride. Swimming, floating and relaxing and clicking pictures. All you could see was crystal clear water and beautiful shades of blue around till far. \nüòç\n‚Ä¢ Fishing- none of us were interested in it so we didn't do fishing. üê†\n\nDefinitely a mesmerising experience for sea lovers.‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§",
